### Hi there! 👋 
- My name is Richard Rodrigues and I am a Machine Learning Engineer
- I'm currently working on a Reddit comments summarizer (Ideaflux: https://github.com/C-opt/idea_flux)
- I'm currently learning about natural language processing (for the comments summarizer)
- I'm looking for help with 
  - designing a data structure for efficiently editting graphs with 20k nodes or more (add, remove, change node content)
  - visualizing such graph (which graph structures should it render? which ones should it not render?) 
- You can reach me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardjunior/
